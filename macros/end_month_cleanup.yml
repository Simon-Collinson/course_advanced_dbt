          A macro to correct end_month data. Used in two situations:
          1. For users that cancel in the first month, set their end_month to next month because the subscription remains active until the end of the first month
          2. For users who haven't ended their subscription yet (end_month is NULL) set the end_month to one month from the current date (these rows will be removed from the final CTE)
    arguments:
      - name: start_month
        type: string
        description: The start_month of the user's subscription.
      - name: end_month
        type: string
        description: The original end_month of the user's subscription. May be NULL.
